### Version 0.0.9 (2023-11-11)

* A new parameter is supported, to control Compressed proofs creation
* Compressed proofs can now emulate those created by mmj2 (but alternative behavior are allowed)

### Version 0.0.10 (2023-11-14)

* A new 'Create Model' command has been added, enabling users to directly update the model for step suggestions from within the extension.
